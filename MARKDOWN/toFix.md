[] If you look closely to the right and left of the login/registration/forgot-password page, there appears to be a sliver on the right and left showing the background from App.css for some reason

[] Minor bug in the Account settings page. When a user enters nothing for the "title" field, it keeps their last saved title and doesn't replace empty inputs with "Newbie"

[] When trying to add a bullet list in the biography MD editor, it's not being displayed correctly; nor is it being displayed in a list in the profile page

[] Deleting an account doesn't seem to delete your session and log you out

- It seems to work fine if you create an account through Google, though

[] The user bio markdown rendering needs some work

- If you don't create an account through Google, on the Security settings tab, there's a minor CSS issue
