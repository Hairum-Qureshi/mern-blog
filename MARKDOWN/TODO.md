1. On GitHub, before making your mern-blog repo public, remove the .env file

=> Figure out how to prevent the .env file from being pushed to Github despite it being added to the .gitignore file

2. _MIGHT_ need to create a .env file for the clientID used in App.tsx

3. Add the ability to see your password when typing it in the input fields for the registration forms

4. Maybe add loading feature to login button, forgot password, change password buttons too
